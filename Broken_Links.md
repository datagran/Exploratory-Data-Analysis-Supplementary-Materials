#### Broken Links

One challenge in maintaining a course like this, is how quickly internet links change or disappear!

**Week2: Exploratory graphs part2**

**Week 3: hierarchical clustering :Code for Prettier dendrograms**

<https://github.com/DataScienceSpecialization/courses/blob/master/04_ExploratoryAnalysis/clusteringExample/myplclust.R>

**Week4: air pollution case study data set**

<https://github.com/rdpeng/courses/blob/master/04_ExploratoryAnalysis/CaseStudy/pm25_data.zip> Note: Whilst you can find the moved file on the EPA website -it has been reformatted . It is easier to follow the lecture using the unchanged github file .

#### Supplementary Links

**Lecture notes with copy-able code and direct links**

<https://github.com/DataScienceSpecialization/courses/tree/master/04_ExploratoryAnalysis>

Choose the .md document of the desired lecture!

**Alternative Lecture Transcripts**

The same link as above alt lecture transcripts

<https://github.com/DataScienceSpecialization/courses/tree/master/04_ExploratoryAnalysis>

Some people find these transcripts clearer than those accompanying the lectures : click transcript.txt within each lecture file.

**The datascience specialisation community site**

Additional goodies provided by mentors.Materials for Exploratory Data Analysis include some excellent course notes and a demonstration of how to plot the PM25 emissions data on Chloropeth map of the USA.
